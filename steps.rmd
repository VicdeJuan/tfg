TO CONTINUE AT:

factorial problem, proving partial correctness.



To add at some point:

·) Importance of axioms:
The paper “Synchronizing clocks in the presence
of faults” (Lamport & Melliar-Smith, JACM
1985) introduced the Interactive Convergence
Algorithm for clock synchronization, and
presented a ‘proof’ of it.
A later attempt to reproduce this by Rushby and
von Henke in a mechanical theorem prover
(EHDM) discovered serious flaws.
The paper presented five supporting lemmas and
one main correctness theorem.
Lemmas 1, 2, and 3 were all false. Lemma 4 was
false too, but only because of a minor
typographical error. The proof of the main
induction in the final theorem was wrong.

\chapter{Development\label{sec:develpment}}

\paragraph{Abstract} In this chapter, the practical work will be exposed. Until now, just the theoretical fundamentals of the subject have been defined.

Here we will expose the rigorous methodology used to mathematically prove our goals. To achieve that, some tools have been developed, and they will be described too.

Finally, we will cover the axioms we needed to prove all the intermediate and the final steps. The completeness of this theory will be discussed at the end of the chapter.

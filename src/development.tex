\chapter{Development\label{sec:develpment}}

\paragraph{Abstract} In this chapter, the practical work will be exposed. Until now, just the theoretical fundamentals of the subject have been defined.

Here we will expose the rigorous methodology used to mathematically prove our goals. To achieve that, some tools have been developed, and they will be described too.

Finally, we will cover the axioms we needed to prove all the intermediate and the final steps. The completeness of this theory will be discussed at the end of the chapter.

\label{proof:Preserve}

With everything exposed before we have been able to prove the invariance of \invPreserve invariant.

\subsection{Axioms}

The set of relevant axioms needed to prove all the invariants is presented in this part.
%
There are a lot of secondary axioms needed by \spass that have been omitted. 
%
The omitted axioms refer to the sorting (\spass is not multi-sorted as the theory we work with), to constants (\spass does not include arithmetic, so $0$,$1$,... must be defined as unique 0-ary functions). 
%
The set of axioms is:

\chapter{Design\label{chap:design}}

\paragraph{Abstract} In this chapter we cover the description of the theory used. As we mentioned before is the linked list theory, but one may implement this theory in many different ways. 

Once the theory we are working with is defined, we will expose the goals we intend to prove and which are the intermediate steps to prove the safety of this theory.

\section{Linked list theory}

\subsection{Description}

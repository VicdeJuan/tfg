\chapter{Design\label{chap:design}}

\paragraph{Abstract} In this chapter we cover the description of the theory used. As we mentioned before is the linked list theory, but one may implement this theory in many different ways. 

Once the theory we are working with is defined, we will expose the goals we intend to prove and which are the intermediate steps to prove the safety of this theory.


\section{Program correctness}


We are finally ready to apply this concepts to a real word problem. In this \thisworkm we apply those concepts to prove some properties of programs.
%
The remaining task is to define the framework and the conventions we use to prove formally properties of programs.

There are two forms of proving correctness. 
%
\textbf{Partial correctness} by proving safety properties (\ref{def::safety}).
%
\textbf{Total correctness} by including liveness properties, such as \textit{the program always finishes} (\ref{def::liveness}). 
%
We will cover each concept in a section of this chapter.



\label{def:SPL}
\input{src/spl}


\subsection{Partial correctness (Safety)}

A function (or the whole program) is \textbf{partially correct} if when the function's precondition is satisfied on entry, its postcondition is satisfied when the function returns (if it ever does).
%
We present the \textbf{inductive assertion method} for proving partial correctness.


Let $\tau$ be the \gls{FOL} property to study. 
%
The procedure is the following:
%
First each function is reduced to a finite set of \gls{FOL} formulae called \concept[Verification condition]{\gls{VC}}.
%
\footnote{This reduction is done with the basic reducing cases we studied in \ref{def:SPL}.}
%
We achieve to prove that $\tau$ is valid in every state of the execution.
%
\textbf{Induction} is the methodology used.
%
First, we assert $\tau$ is valid before the program starts (induction base).
%
Then, we assume $\tau$ in the precondition and prove $\tau'$ valid.



Some examples are studied next to clarify the procedure.

\section{Parametrized systems}

The correctness of just one thread executing a program it is an easy problem because it runs sequentiality.
%
Multiple threads executing the same program is a different and more difficult problem to solve.
%
If the number of threads executing is not bounded is another important and difficult step.
%
If the number of threads is bound, one could unroll the formula for all the threads in the problem and try to prove it. 
%
This is why we focus the unbounded case, which is the usual scenario.

We are going to study those cases. 
%
To do so, we need to parametrize the program executed by multiple threads.
%
Typically the threads would be $i$,$j$,$k_0$,$k_1$,... 
%
\subsubsection{Arbitrary number of threads}

For example, the web servers may not have a bound of the number of clients they can accept.
%
Can we prove correctness when an unbounded number of processes are using the same global variabless?

A recent research \citeapos{paperParametrizedInvariants} has proven a very important result. 
%
We will enunciate it and discuss it because it is fundamental for this work. 
%
We will not prove any of the results proven in \citep{paperParametrizedInvariants}.

Before we enunciate the theorem, we need some previous concepts.
%
We need to extend the concept of support to parametrized formulas.


\begin{defn}[Support]
  Let $\psi$, $A$ and $B$ be parametrized formulas, and let $S$ be the
  set of possible substitutions from the set of parametrized variables in $\psi$ ($\Var(\psi)$) into the set of parametrized variables of $(A\Into B)$ ($\Var(A\Into B)$).
%
  We say that $\psi$ supports $(A\Into B)$, whenever
%
  \[ \big( (\bigwedge_{\sigma\in S} \sigma(\psi)\big) \andcond A\big) \Into B \hspace{4em} \text{is valid} \]
%
  We use $\psi\supports(A\Into B)$ as a short notation for
  $\big((\bigwedge_{\sigma\in S} \sigma(\psi)) \andcond A\big) \Into B$.  
\end{defn}

Note that if $S'\subseteq S$ is a subset of the substitutions, and 
%
  \[ \big( (\bigwedge_{\sigma\in S'} \sigma(\psi)\big) \andcond A\big) \Into B \hspace{4em} \text{is valid} \]
%
then
%
  \[ \big( (\bigwedge_{\sigma\in S} \sigma(\psi)\big) \andcond A\big) \Into B \hspace{4em} \text{is also valid} \]
%
  Essentially, if one is successful proving the validity of a formula obtained by removing some of the conjuncts from the antecedent, the validity of the full formula holds.
%
  Hence, in practice, it is enough to consider only some of the partial substitutions to show that a support formula is valid.


\begin{itheorem}[Bound an arbitrary number of threads]
	Let $\varphi$ be a thread-parametrized formula, where $\overline{k}=\Var(\varphi)$. 
	%
	Let $\tau$ be a transition of $P$ and $\ThetaParam$ the initial condition.

	To show that $P$ satisfies $\Always\varphi$:
	\hspace{-1em}
	\[ 
		\begin{array}{r@{\;\;}lr@{\;}@{\;}cl@{\hspace{1em}}l}
			\Premise{S1}. & & \ThetaParam(\overline{k}) &\supports & \varphi & \\

			\Premise{S2}. & \varphi \supports & \tau^{(i)} &\Into& \varphi'  & \text{forall $\tau$ and all $i\in \overline{k}$}\\
			\Premise{S3}. & \varphi\supports & \big(\bigwedge\limits_{x\in\Var(\varphi)} j\neq x \andcond \tau^{(j)} &\Into& \varphi' \big)& \text{forall $\tau$ and one fresh $j\notin\overline{k}$}\\ \hline
			& \multicolumn{4}{c}{\hspace{3em} \Always \varphi} &
		\end{array}
	\]
\label{thm:biggest}
\end{itheorem}


Using this powerful result, we have reduced an arbitrary number of processes sharing the same variables to a finite number of threads sharing the variable. 
%
We will refer to $\Premise{S1}$ as \textit{initiation}, to $\Premise{S2}$ self-consecution and to $\Premise{S3}$ others-consecution.

\section{Linked list theory}

\subsection{Description}

\begin{defn}[Lock-coupling linked list]
A lock-coupling concurrent list~\cite{herlihy08art,vafeiadis06proving} is 
a concurrent data type that implements a set by maintaining in the heap an 
ordered single-linked list with non-repeating elements.
%
Each node in the list is protected by a lock which guarantees that a 
single thread can access a list node at the same time.
%
\end{defn}

When a thread traverses the list, it acquires the lock of the node
that it visits, and only releases this lock after the lock of the
successor node has been successfully acquired.
%
This technique of protecting cells with locks (instead of protecting
the whole data-structure with a single coarse-grain lock) is known as
\emph{fine-grained locking}.

%
Nodes of a concurrent lock-coupling list are instances of the following 
\ListNode class:
%
\[
  \begin{array}{ll}
	  \class & \Node  \;\{\\
	  		&\begin{array}{l}
				Elem \:\;\; data; \;\\
				Addr \:\;\; next; \;\\
				Lock \:\;\; lock; \;
			\end{array}\\
		&\}
  \end{array}
\]
%
Where:
\begin{itemize}
		\item \fData, the value stored in the node, which is also used to keep 
			the list ordered;
		\item \fNext, a pointer that stores the address of the next node in 
			the list; and
		\item \fLock, which contains the lock protecting the node.
\end{itemize}

We assume that the operating system provides the atomic operations \fLock 
and \fUnlock. 

\concept{Ghost variable} are variables which are not properly in the program but are added to 
achieve the verification needed.

Our implementation of concurrent lock-coupling lists has 4 global variables.
%
Two of them are
global addresses \head and \tail, and the other two are ghost global variables \region 
and \elements:
%
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=\figscale]{graphics/_lists_classes}
\end{center}
%
The declared global program variables are:
%
\begin{enumerate}
		\item A variable \head, of type address, which points to the 
			first node of the list which has the lowest possible value ($-\infty$).
		\item A variable \tail, of type address, which points to the 
			last node of the list  which has the lowest possible value ($+\infty$).
		\item A ghost variable \region, of type set of addresses, which is 
			used to keep track of the portion of the heap whose cells form the 
			list.
		\item A ghost variable \elements, of type set of elements, which 
			represents the collection of elements stored in the list.
\end{enumerate}


We consider \head and \tail sentinel nodes which are neither removed nor 
modified and we assume that the list is initialized with \head and \tail 
already set.
%
The set \region is initialized containing solely the addresses of \head 
and \tail.
%
Similarly, the set \elements is initialized containing only the elements 
initially stored at the nodes pointed by \head and \tail.
%
There is also a function \concept{havocListElem}() which returns a random element. 

In figure \ref{fig:listcode} we present the program we are going to use, written in \gls{SPL}, with the assume. We can see there are three procedures, \Search, \Insert and \Remove.

\subsection{TL3}
\todo{This section should be removed?}

\emph{Theory of Linked Lists with Locks} \TLLpL, is the theory we use for describing linked-list heap memory layout.
%
\TLLpL is a multi-sorted first-order theory.

In this section \TLLpL is defined with the purpose we have. 
%
A more complete definition of \TLLpL can be found in \citeapos{paperAle} and \citep[6.2]{thesisAle}.

\paragraph{Theories: } The theories used in \TLLpL, informally: 
$\Sigma_{cells}$ models \emph{cells}, 
	structures containing an element (data), an address (pointer) and a lock owner,
		which represents a node in a linked list.
%
$\Sigma_{mem}$ models the memory.
%
$\Sigma_{setaddr}$ models sets of addresses.
%
$\Sigma_{settid}$ models sets of thread identifiers.
%
$\Sigma_{setelem}$ models sets of elements.
%
$\Sigma_{reach}$ models finite sequences of non-repeating addresses,
to represent acyclic paths in memory.
%
Finally, $\Sigma_{Bridge}$ is a \emph{bridge theory} containing auxiliary
functions, for example, that allow to map paths of addresses to set of 
addresses, or to obtain the set of addresses reachable from a given 
address following a chain of \fNext fields.

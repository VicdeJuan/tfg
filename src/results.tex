\chapter{Results\label{chap:results}}

\paragraph{Abstract} In this chapter we will expose the structure of the generated proofs. We will mention some of the most relevant and difficult intermediate steps that we needed to prove.

Finally, the we will compare the timings of using automatic theorem provers versus model searching done by \gls{leap}.

\chapter{Results\label{chap:results}}

\paragraph{Abstract}

This chapter describes the set of axioms needed to prove the target verification problem and the justifies the relevance of the axioms.
%
We will cover briefly the generated proofs and some complexity results.
%
Finally, we report a time analysis, comparing this \gls{ATP} to model checkers and the different inner steps of the methodology.


\section{Axioms}

We introduce now the set of relevant axioms needed to prove all the invariants.
%
There are some secondary axioms needed by \spass that have been omitted. 
%
The omitted axioms refer: 
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item to the sorting (\spass is not multi-sorted as the theory we work with. It is necessary to define that an \addr is not an \elem, an \elem is not an \addr, etc)
	\item to constants (\spass does not include arithmetic, so $0$,$1$,... must be defined as unique 0-ary functions specifying that $0\not\eq 1,0\not\eq 2$,...)
	\item to the local and global variables of the program (\leap is quantifier free but \spass needs to quantify every variable)
\end{itemize}  
%
The set of axioms has been divided in groups. 
%
The division is as follows
		
\label{ax::fulllist}
\input{src/axioms}


The full list of axioms has been listed in appendix \ref{spass:syntax_file}. 

%

We claim that there is no need for more axioms than the ones defined at \ref{ax::fulllist}. 
%
The next section will present which axioms are needed for proving each invariants.

\section{Analysis of generated proofs}
\label{proof:Preserve}
\label{sec:axiomgraph}

\paragraph{Example}
Lets take \invDisjoint\footnote{Its full definition is at \ref{inv::full:disjoint}} as an example.
%
We aim to prove that \invDisjoint is an invariant. To do so, we need to prove its VCs valid.
%
There are only needed 3 axioms: the axiom which states that numbers are different and the 2 axioms which states $i$ and $j$ are threads. 
%
With these 3 axiom, \spass can prove valid all the \spass problems associated with \invDisjoint.


To clarify the process described in \ref{ProcessDescription} we expose all the \spass problems generated to prove that \invDisjoint is an invariant.
%
There are 362 \spass problems. Half of them correspond to the \reducedProblem and the other half to the \smallToBig problem.
%
For each half, there are 181 \spass problems:
%
For \textbf{\instantiation} there is one problem. 
%
For self-consecution there are 60 \spass problems. The program has 55 statements, so there is a \gls{VC} for each line except for \textit{while} and \textit{if} statements which have 2 \gls{VC} associated depending on the validity of the condition. As there are 3 while and 2 if, we have 60 \spass problems for each thread.
%
As \invDisjoint involves 2 threads, there are \textbf{120 self-consecution \spass problems}.
%
Finally for \textbf{Others consecution} there are \textbf{60} \spass problems.

\paragraph{Analysis}

Most of the transitions (\numTransitionsProvedWithPC in \numTotalTransitions) are proven without any relevant axiom. 
%
Some of them do not even need any axiom. 
%
\smallToBig problems usually do not need any axiom, because there are simple but big \gls{FOL} formulas.

Table \ref{table:analysisProofs}  contains some global information about the proof of each invariant.
%
It is important to mention that every invariant has 2 problems of \instantiation. 

\begin{table}[hbtp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c|cccc}
Invariant & Self-consecution & Others consecution & Total & Number of axioms used\\\hline
\input{src/tex/analysisTable.tex}
\end{tabular}
\label{table:analysisProofs}
\caption{Number of \spass problems by invariant.}
\end{table}



In terms of the number of axioms needed, it is interesting to see that \invLock is the most complicated, followed by \invNext.  
%
The easiest is \invDisjoint, which only uses \textit{nums-are-different} (\ref{ax::nums_are_different}) and axioms related with sorts (there are 2 threads involved in the formula which are different from one another.)
\\
The differences on the number of other-consecution problem is caused by the splitting on complex \spass problems. 
%
To prove \invOrder all other-consecution problems have been splat, but for \invLock and \invNext just 21 other consecution problems have been splat.
%
Despite that fact, \invOrder is not very complex in terms of total number of axioms needed.

Another interesting data to look at in order to study the difficult of each invariant is the number of axioms needed in each problem. 
%
Figure \ref{fig:frequencyAxioms} shows the number of problems solved against the number of axioms needed.
%
The graphic illustrate the number of problems solved normalized by the total amount of problems that invariant involves.
%
As it was stated before, most of the problems can be proven without any axiom, or just with the axioms of sorts and numbers to reason about the \pc.
%
Looking to the figure, the difficulty of each axiom in terms of the axioms used in each problem is more precise:
%
\invOrder needs more axioms in general than the rest.

\label{fig:frequencyAxioms}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Special Transitions}

Due to the limited space, we can not explore deeply the proof of the invariants.
%
However, some we offer a brief analysis of the complicated transitions for the most important invariant: \invPreserve. The complicated transitions are the ones modifying the heap: \textit{locks}, \textit{insertion} and \textit{removal}. 
%
The transitions including \textit{locks} and \textit{unlocks} can be proven easily with the axioms, because a \fLock does not modify the content nor the pointer; thus, it can not break the list nor disorder the list.
%
For the other transitions some expert knowledge is needed, because \spass lacks information to finish the proof.
%
This limitation is that \spass does not know how to choose the axioms to use, leading into an unnecessary exploration of a branch of the proof. 
%
\label{infty:time}
If \spass could know that, it would be much more efficient. 
%
As a consequence, transitions 35 and 55 have been subdivided in to a number of smaller \spass problems, reducing manually in each case the number of axioms needed and leaving the ones which could be relevant.
%

\section{Time analysis}
\label{sec:timeanalysis}

\subsection{Proof generation}

All the times shown refer to the time \spass takes to prove the validity of each problem. 
%
Previous parsing and creating the proper input to \spass has been ignored.


\subsection{Proof Checking}

One of the greatest consequences of this method is the possibility to refute the generated proofs and double check that they are valid.
%
We developed the solution such that for each \spass problem there are three files generated. 
%
The \spass output (storing the information of which axioms have been used and the running time), the \spass proof in \spass format and the \spass proof in TPTP syntax (\cite{tptp}).
%
By generating a TPTP proof for each \spass problem we made possible to check these proofs with any other theorem prover as \citetool{vampire} or \citetool{issabelle}.

Another advantage of the generation of these files is the reduced amount of time needed to check the validity of the fine-grained-linked-list implementation. 
%
There is no need to regenerate all the verification conditions and regenerate all the \spass files and let \spass run until it finds the proof for every problem. 
%
One can just run \spass on the generated proofs and will save lot of time.
%
Lets see the amount of time needed to check the proofs instead of generate them.


\subsection{Comparing times}

In order to use formal verification in real environments, a time analysis is fundamental. 
%
The more time it takes, the more useless formal verification is.
%
How much time does it takes to generate all the proofs for this linked-list implementation? 
%
And more importantly,  How much time does it takes to check the generated proofs? 

In Table \ref{anaylisis::bigtimetable} one can find the summary of the timing according to four different activities. The first column refers to the time that \leap takes to prove the invariant (obtained from \cite{paperParametrizedInvariants}). 
%
The second column, \textit{Full process}, refers to the time the whole process takes\footnote{The full process is described in \ref{ProcessDescription}}. 
%
This is, generating the verification conditions, creating all the \spass problems and letting \spass work to solve each problem.
%
The third column, \textit{Sum of \spass time}, refers to the amount of time that \spass takes to solve all the problems of each invariant.
%
This column shows the real time necessary to generate the proofs, from the already generated files.
%
Finally, the last column shows very important information,
%
which is amount of time needed to check that the proofs are correct is less than every other method. 
%
This method reduces significantly the time spent in checking the formal verification of a problem.

\begin{tabular}{r|rrrr}
Invariant 		& Leap 	& Full process 		& Sum of \spass time 	& Check proofs 	\\\hline

\label{analysis:bigtimetable}
\end{table}


There are some very relevant issues with the measures of the \textit{Full process} time and the \textit{Sum of \spass time}.

\paragraph{About measuring the full process}
In order to improve performance, all \spass problems are first considered as if they were the simplest. 
%
If it took \spass too much time to (according to a timeout) to find a proof for a problem, then the problem would be automatically divided.
%
This approach allows to prove simple problems very quickly, such as the majority of \invDisjoint transitions for example. 
%
When a problem is not so simple (again, according to the timeout), then it is divided and some time has been wasted because the initial attempt to prove the problem is terminated.
%
The value of this timeout is not trivial to be set.
%
There are transitions which do not need any axioms. 
%
This is caused because of VCs of the form $(\mathit{false} \to \mathit{something})$.
%
For these transitions, it is usual that \spass takes less than one second to prove them. 
%
Thus, we could set the timeout to one second. 
%
If a transition is taking more than one second, then it may need more axioms and or it should be divided.
%
But we may incur into dividing a problem which does not need to be divided. 
%
Others consecution for transition 33 in \invLock takes 1 second and a half, but does not need to be divided because it is of the form $(false \to something)$.
%
A timeout of 1 second would make \gandalf to divided this transition, but a timeout of 2 seconds would cause a waste of 1 second in each not simple \spass problem.
%
The timeout had been setted to 100 seconds because it was preferable in order to generate less \spass problems, and consequently less proofs.

The problem explained before acquires more relevance in another context.
%
\spass does not have an expert knowledge about which axioms should be used first because they are relevant and which should not.
%
No arithmetic axiom is needed to prove \invRegion and \spass does not neither need any axiom about the order relation between elements. 
%
There is a subset of axioms for each invariant.
%
Including unnecessary axioms may cause \spass to take more time searching for the proof in a branch where the proof cannot be found. 
%
It may not cause any delay because it finds the proof without exploring all the branches.
%
We show an example of this reality.
%
Transition 11 of the \invPreserve takes 23 seconds to \spass when all the axioms are included but it takes 0.44 seconds when only used axioms are included. 
%
This difference has been an important challenge, because when \spass could not find a proof it did not necessarily mean that the problem was unsatisfiable. 
%
It could mean that too many unnecessary axiom had been included or that the problem needed to be divided.
%
Thus, the third column shows the real amount of time that \spass has needed to generate the proofs. 
%
This time is not the lowest bound one could get, but as one can see, it is less than the whole process.
%
For the transition mentioned before, \spass takes 0.11 seconds to check that the proof is correct.
%
For \invPreserve there are two transitions whose proof were completed manually, as we explained in \ref{infty:time}.

\chapter{Inductive Assertion Method}

This example is proposed to illustrate the inductive assertion method. 
%
A simple program, which one can see it should work perfectly is verified manually applying the method.

\chapter{Code}
\label{app:code}

The code is shown with annotations and not with line numbers in order to better understand the invariants.
%
These annotations are used to express the invariants. 
%
The lines of code wrapped by ':tag$\left[\right.$\;'  and ':tag$\left.\right]$\;' are used to define the preconditions of the invariants. 
%
In stead of: \textit{(\pc(i) $\leq$ n $\wedge$ \pc(i) $\geq$ m  $\to$ ...)} ; it is written: \textit{(@tag $\to$ )}.
%
This way is clearer to read the invariants within the code.


We consider \head and \tail sentinel nodes which are neither removed nor 
modified and we assume that the list is initialized with \head and \tail 
already set.
%
The set \region is initialized containing solely the addresses of \head 
and \tail.
%
Similarly, the set \elements is initialized containing only the elements 
initially stored at the nodes pointed by \head and \tail.
%
There is also a function \concept{havocListElem}() which returns a random element.

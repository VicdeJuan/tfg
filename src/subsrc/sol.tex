In \gls{SOL} the quantifiers can be used related to functions and/or predicates. This gives lot of possibilities to reason about the universe and problems but adds lot of complexity. 

In the theory of equality (\ref{theory:equality}) we could have defined axioms of congruence by:

\[\forall f \left( \forall \gor{x},\gor{y} \left( \bigwedge_{i=1}^n x_i = y_i \right) \implies f(\gor{x}) = f(\gor{y}) \right)\]
\[\forall P \left( \forall \gor{x},\gor{y} \left( \bigwedge_{i=1}^n x_i = y_i \right) \implies P(\gor{x}) \dimplies P(\gor{y}) \right)\]

This is a simpler way of writing but a more complex way of reasoning.

\gls{SOL} is a very powerful tool in order to express formulas.

However, because it is not possible to reason automatically in theories of second order, we have not used any second-order logic and we do not develop it further.
